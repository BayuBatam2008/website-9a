# Welcome
This starter will help you build a relatively simple blog with a few key features, while using the Eleventy static site generator.

This eleventy starter already includes:
- Basic site navigation with eleventy-navigation
- Blog categories & category based navigation
- Image optimisation with Eleventy-img
- SVG icons with svg-icon-sprite
- SEO (sitemap, metadata, robots.txt)
- Luxon for handling dates & times
- A few basic Eleventy configurations, filters and shortcodes
- Nunjucks templates
- Sass & the necessary scripts to compile Sass

If the listed setup is not what you require, you might want to check out one of the many other Eleveny starters, which can be found here: [Eleventy Starter Projects](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/)
